The installation is quite easy.Highly recommended,Write speed is 60-70 at normal with a minimal level of 65 and peaks at 156..in mobileUPDATETHE DISAPPOINTING THING IS REED SPEED... I got upto 90 Mbps read and it won't goes beyond 90mbps but write speed sometimes peaks at 120 Mbps... I GOT THIS MEMORY CARD ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF READ SPEED NOT FOR WRITING SPEED..because I won't use this in any action camera or DSLR... ONLY FOR MOBILE WHICH NEEDS ATLEAST 150 Mbps for SMOOTH performance.....I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED FOR MY PURPOSE BUT satisfied.. according to price..So my conclusion if you are looking for a memory card for 4k/8k recording you can surely go for it..I case of u are purchasing on seeing it's read speed and also for mobile it wouldn't be a better option...,Expensive product,Good,Nice memory card,The delivered one was 90Mbps write property, i was expecting 190mbps write property,119gb Storage out of 128gb.
