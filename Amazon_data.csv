The installation is quite easy.Highly recommended,Write speed is 60-70 at normal with a minimal level of 65 and peaks at 156..in mobileUPDATETHE DISAPPOINTING THING IS REED SPEED... I got upto 90 Mbps read and it won't goes beyond 90mbps but write speed sometimes peaks at 120 Mbps... I GOT THIS MEMORY CARD ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF READ SPEED NOT FOR WRITING SPEED..because I won't use this in any action camera or DSLR... ONLY FOR MOBILE WHICH NEEDS ATLEAST 150 Mbps for SMOOTH performance.....I AM TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED FOR MY PURPOSE BUT satisfied.. according to price..So my conclusion if you are looking for a memory card for 4k/8k recording you can surely go for it..I case of u are purchasing on seeing it's read speed and also for mobile it wouldn't be a better option...,Expensive product,Good,Nice memory card,The delivered one was 90Mbps write property, i was expecting 190mbps write property,119gb Storage out of 128gb.

Product Quality is decent but the only problem I m facing is that is incompatible with with my Tablet and My Mobile Phone.If it was Compatible it would be great and Sometimes it Just keep Disconnecting from the device. I don't know if it's my device or its the product anyways it's a good product to have all times.,Connecting pin was a bit tight to insert to my Macbook. Getting it for 399 from this brand is what made me order this. Go for it if you work only with usb devices. You can access 4 devices at a time but not sure about the speed while switchinf the windows. For now its quite okay to browse the files when one pen drive is connected.,USB port is somewhat not easy to plug. When connected to laptop its hard to remove it smoothly.,Served the purpose and delivered as marketed,I bought it for â¹451Overall 8/1010/10 Build- Sturdy and premium no doubt7/10 Functionality- 1 USB 3.0 Port (side one) & 3 USB 2.0(front 3)- My SSD gave 330ish MB/s Read/Write(seq) on the 3.0 Port (less for random read-write)- Same SSD gave 50ish(max) MB/s Read/Write(seq) on the 2.0 PortEven tho for me it is ok, they could've provided us with more high-speed ports(3.0),Cord is too short and price too high!,Bought this to use for connecting Mouse and Keyboard to my MacBook and have been using this for the last 6 months. Before buying this, i looked at multiple products at various price ranges. Finally, chose this product as this offers the brand assurance and is way cheaper compared to similar items from other reliable brands. So far, working really well ð,nice way to use usb-a devices on macbook air m2 in a cheap price","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/21qdAZyu9xL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg","https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-MPORT-Type-Ports-Transfer/dp/B09M869Z5V/ref=sr_1_183?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-183"
